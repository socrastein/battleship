This is the final project for the vanilla JavaScript course in The Odin Project. 

The game is designed to be played on a phone or tablet with a friend, using a pass screen with a 5 second timer before enabling a continue button so as to keep player board settings private. 

Using drag & drop to place the ships on the board was presented as an extra challenge to consider. Being something of a masochist who loves a challenge, I resolved to make that work and learned a lot in the process.
